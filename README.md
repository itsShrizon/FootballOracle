# FootballOracle

FootballOracle is a machine learning system designed to predict football match outcomes using historical data. This project leverages advanced techniques in data processing, feature engineering, and ensemble modeling to provide accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Utilizes historical football match data for training and prediction.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implements sophisticated feature extraction and selection techniques.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize the feature space.
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Combines XGBoost and LSTM models for robust predictions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employs Bayesian optimization for fine-tuning model parameters.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses model accuracy using log loss and Brier score metrics.

## Technical Stack

- Python
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and model evaluation
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for LSTM implementation
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FootballOracle.git
   cd FootballOracle
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow xgboost
   ```

   Alternatively, if you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install all dependencies at once:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To run the FootballOracle system:

1. Prepare your data in the required format (CSV, JSON, or as specified in the data processing scripts).
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python football_oracle.py
   ```



## Model Architecture

The FootballOracle uses an ensemble approach, combining:
1. XGBoost: A gradient boosting framework known for its speed and performance.
2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Implemented using TensorFlow, this recurrent neural network architecture is suited for sequence prediction problems.

## Evaluation Metrics

The system's performance is evaluated using:
- Log Loss: Measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.
- Brier Score: Quantifies the accuracy of probabilistic predictions, particularly useful for binary outcomes.
